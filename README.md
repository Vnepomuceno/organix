# Organix, Serious Game

#### COLLECT IMPLICIT ORGANISATIONAL KNOWLEDGE THROUGH A GAMING PLATFORM

## Overview

Development of a serious game in the context of a MSc. Computer Science thesis based on the creation of a multi-player application that engages players in eliciting the business processes they are involved, within the organisation they operate professionally. The game integrates features that make possible the creation of structured business process models. Additionally, the gaming platform motivates players in building the most accurate representation, and not only stimulates competitiveness between players to determine who achieves the best process model, but also encourages cooperation among players, to obtain the best possible business process representation, considering the point of view of all participants involved.
